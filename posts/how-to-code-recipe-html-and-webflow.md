title: How to code a recipe in HTML and on Webflow
description: How to use the Recipe schema in plain html or on Webflow to have the correct metadata for your recipe - so it can be imported to recipe apps, etc.

## The Problem

I wanted to figure out how to code a recipe so that it can be imported into a recipe app like [Plan to Eat](https://www.plantoeat.com/welcome/) or show up nicely in Google search results or on my Google Home.

## Solution Summary

Add your recipe info as a json block in a `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag, following the [Recipe JSON Schema](https://schema.org/Recipe) from [schema.org](https://schema.org). See the [Google developer docs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe) for more.

## The Explanation

In order for Google to know which parts of your page are recipe instructions - ingredients, steps, time to cook, etc - versus other kinds of content - like the long, winding story you'll probably tell before your recipe - you need to put the recipe instructions in a JSON block on the page as well. So your recipe content will be duplicated in two forms - as html on the page for users to read, and as JSON in a script tag for computers to read.

You'll need to follow the [Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) schema from [schema.org](https://schema.org/) when creating your JSON block, because that's the common standard. For example, if you wanted to add your recipe's list of ingredients, that would look like:

```json
{
  "recipeIngredient": [
    "0.5 teaspoon olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for topping",
    "1 cup marinara sauce, heated, or more as needed",
    "1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
  ]
}
```

### Basic HTML example

You'll put the JSON schema content in a `script` block with a `type` of `"application/ld+json"`, either in your `head` tag or at the end of your `body` tag. You can also test your code with Google via their [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to see what it looks like and if it's valid. See the simple example below from [Google developer docs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe).

```html

        ]
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ... your recipe page content goes here

```

### In Webflow

If you're using [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) to create your site, and you have your Recipes as a [CMS Collection](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/intro-to-webflow-cms?topics=cms-dynamic-content), you can use the custom code section of the CMS collection template settings to dynamically insert this schema per recipe.

1. Go to edit your website in the Designer
2. Scroll down to on your CMS Collection template page in the pages navigation
3. Hover over the page
4. Click on the settings/cog icon
5. Scroll down to the Custom Code section
6. Add your `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag with your JSON inside
7. Use the `+ Add Field` button to dynamically put in things like the recipe name, prepTime, ingredients, etc. for each collection item.

#### Example images

### Bonus Points: Full HTML example

If you [inspect the code](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open) of this [AllRecipes.com Chicken Parmesan recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/246867/new-improved-chicken-parmesan/), you can see the following script tag, which includes a very fleshed out example of the Recipe schema. You can try this on any recipe site you like to see how they use the schema.
